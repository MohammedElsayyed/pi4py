# This program approximates the value of pi using the Leibniz formula.

# The Leibniz formula for pi [1] is attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm
# Leibniz (1646-1716) [2].  The formula goes as follows:

# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ... = pi/4

# This program expects a single argument on th ecommand line: an integer
# >= 1 indicating the number of terms to compute on the series.

# This is the serial implementation.  See pi4py-p.py for the parallel
# implementation based on MPI.

# This code was initially adapted from this guide [3] published on the
# University of Oregon's Department of Physics on the Advanced Projects
# Lab's wiki.
